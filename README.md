# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

An interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. This project visualizes the dataset through dynamic charts and a demographic information panel.

## Features
- **Dropdown Menu**: Select a test subject ID to view their data.
- **Bar Chart**: Displays the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for the selected subject.
- **Bubble Chart**: Visualizes all OTUs for the selected subject, with marker size representing sample values and color indicating OTU IDs.
- **Metadata Panel**: Shows demographic information for the selected test subject.

Technologies Used
D3.js: For data fetching and DOM manipulation.
Plotly.js: For rendering bar and bubble charts.
Bootstrap 5: For responsive layout and styling.
Dataset Information
The dataset reveals microbial species (OTUs) found in human navels:

Some species are prevalent in over 70% of individuals.
Most species are relatively rare.
Key data fields include:

otu_ids: Microbial species identifiers.
sample_values: Quantities of each OTU in a sample.
otu_labels: Descriptions of each OTU.
